## ⚠️ Health Risks of Smoking
Smoking poses severe health risks, including:

- **Lung Cancer**: Smoking is the leading cause of lung cancer, responsible for approximately 85% of cases.
- **Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD)**: Smoking causes chronic bronchitis and emphysema, collectively known as COPD.
- ❤️ **Heart Disease**: Smoking increases the risk of coronary heart disease and stroke.
- 🤒 **Respiratory Infections**: Smokers are more susceptible to infections like pneumonia and influenza.
- 🛡️ **Reduced Immune Function**: Smoking weakens the immune system, making it harder to fight off infections.
- 👶 **Pregnancy Complications**: Smoking during pregnancy can lead to premature birth, low birth weight, and sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS).
- 🚭 **Secondhand Smoke**: Non-smokers exposed to secondhand smoke are at risk for many of the same diseases as smokers.

## 💪 Quit Smoking
Quitting smoking significantly reduces the risk of developing these diseases. It improves overall health, extends life expectancy, and enhances quality of life. Support and resources are available to help individuals quit smoking, including counseling, medications, and support groups.
